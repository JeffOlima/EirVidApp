EirVidApp is a movie rental system integrated into RTÃ‰ Player, a video streaming service, that enables users to rent movies. This project was the final assignment undertaken during the first semester of the third year of college.

Bekezhan, during his third year of college, took charge of creating an analytical structure for the Movie Rental System. This involved conducting a needs survey, analyzing requirements, creating use case diagrams, setting up a work timeline, and developing sequence diagrams. Bekezhan also contributed to programming and testing, ensuring the system met user needs.

Jefferson, also during the third year of college, was responsible for designing the Class Diagram for the Movie Rental System. He defined the User Object, which could be logged in using the Login Method, and created methods such as Pay, Remove, Rent, RentTimer, and FindMovie to facilitate movie rentals and account management. Jefferson also worked on the Movie Object, implementing methods like MovieList and GetUserInput to enable browsing and selection of movies, as well as entering payment information.

Together, Bekezhan and Jefferson collaborated on this project, which served as their final assignment during the first semester of the third year of college. They successfully built a comprehensive movie rental system that allows users to browse, rent, and manage movies with ease.
